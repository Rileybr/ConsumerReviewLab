My wife and I had dinner with a couple of our close friends this evening at Stanford Grill in Rockville. It was a beautiful Sunday evening and I must say, we had a wonderful experience dining here. It was our first time dining at this restaurant and our server, Sonny, was not only able to help us by answering my wife's questions regarding the gluten free menu, but he was extremely polite and jovial the entire time. I've been to other fine dining establishments, and I must admit, this was, by far, the best service we've ever received. The server was able to recite a mouth full of dinner specials and the way he described the pot roast made me want to order it right away. No surprise, the dish was perfect. Beef melted in my mouth with every bite. He recommended the perfect red wine to go with my dinner as well. My wife ordered to Pear martini and couldn't wait to try to make it at home! I was very impressed with how well seasoned these dishes were, though. Even the dinner rolls were exquisite. The decor was top notch and the live piano added to the ambiance. Our server offered to wrap up our leftovers at the table and went above and beyond by escorting my wife to the restrooms! I am glad we found this hidden gem here in Rockville and cannot wait to return!
